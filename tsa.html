	<h1>Eastlake High School TSA</h1>
	<p>Here you will find information about Eastlake's TSA chapter, along with a list of our CTE courses and their descriptions.</p>
  <h2>Our Chapter</h2>
  <p>Eastlake High School is a four-year public high school in Sammamish, Washington. It was opened in 1993 and is part of the Lake Washington School District. It is known for its many sports programs, including a dominant football team, but non-athletic clubs also make up a large portion of Eastlake.
The TSA chapter in Eastlake began in 2012 and it has been growing ever since. Throughout the three years, the club has placed in the top three for several events including video game design, on-demand video, and fashion design. Recently, the club added a student board to keep up with the fast growing size and participated in the leadership event at Microsoft.</p>

      <li>Computing has revolutionized almost every part of our lives. In this course we will explore how and why that’s the case through current topics regarding technology and computer science. Through project based learning, we will apply those current topics into daily activities and projects. Learning how computing affects us is only a small part of what we will discover. You will learn the nuts and bolts of programming through the BYOB platform and, most importantly, you’ll learn how to transform your ideas into code.</li>
