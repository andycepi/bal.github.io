	<h1>Eastlake High School TSA</h1>
	<p>Here you will find information about Eastlake's TSA chapter, along with a list of our CTE courses and their descriptions.</p>
  <h2>Our Chapter</h2>
  <p>Eastlake High School is a four-year public high school in Sammamish, Washington. It was opened in 1993 and is part of the Lake Washington School District. It is known for its many sports programs, including a dominant football team, but non-athletic clubs also make up a large portion of Eastlake.
The TSA chapter in Eastlake began in 2012 and it has been growing ever since. Throughout the three years, the club has placed in the top three for several events including video game design, on-demand video, and fashion design. Recently, the club added a student board to keep up with the fast growing size and participated in the leadership event at Microsoft.</p>
<p><b>Student Board</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Co-Presidents: Andy Cepollina, Brian Dallaire</li>
    <li>Treasurer: Josh Jensen</li>
    <li>Advisor: Larry Shan</li>

  <h2>Eastlake's CTE Program</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Computer Science</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Computing has revolutionized almost every part of our lives. In this course we will explore how and why that’s the case through current topics regarding technology and computer science. Through project based learning, we will apply those current topics into daily activities and projects. Learning how computing affects us is only a small part of what we will discover. You will learn the nuts and bolts of programming through the BYOB platform and, most importantly, you’ll learn how to transform your ideas into code.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Computer Science & Software Engineering</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This class is designed for anyone interested in a career related to computers, programming and solution design through problem solving. Using Python® as a primary tool and incorporating multiple platforms and languages for computation, this course aims to develop computational thinking, generate excitement about career paths around computing, and introduce professional tools that foster creativity and collaboration. CSE helps students develop programming expertise and explore the workings of the Internet. Projects and problems include app development, visualization of data, cybersecurity, and simulation. Great class for beginners and great class to master the skills needed to learn other programming languages or to enroll in the AP Computer Science class.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>AP Computer Science A</li>
    <ul>
      <li>By the end of this course students will be able to design and implement computer solutions to a variety of problems; understand and apply well-known computer algorithms; understand and take advantage of computer system components; and write well-structured, understandable, and reusable programs using the Java and C# programming languages. Among the computer science algorithms learned are object-oriented design and program construction, program flow and control, common searching and sorting algorithms, variables, arrays, and lists, project design and control.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Software Engineering/Computer Programming – Sammamish Start-Ups</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This class will allow students to apply their computer science skills to design and build technology, such as smart phone applications, robotics, open source software, and control systems. Students work in teams to design and develop original solutions to valid, open-ended problems that will ultimately meet customer need and/or address unmet needs in the commercial, social, and global economy. By applying the design process and cultivating confidence as leaders, they will design, build, and test solutions while collaborating with industry professionals who provide mentoring opportunities. As a course summative, student teams will have the opportunity to present and defend their original solutions to a panel of experts, similar to a Shark Tank. This class lays the foundation for students interested in starting a business and potentially competing in the Lake Washington School District Teen CEO competition.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Introduction to Engineering Design</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduction to Engineering Design’s major focus is to expose students to the design process, research and analysis, teamwork, communication methods, global and human impacts, engineering standards, and technical documentation. IED gives students the opportunity to develop skills and understanding of course concepts through activity-, project-, and problem-based (APPB) learning. Students hone their skills through projects using 3D modeling software, a laser cutter, a 3D printer, and vinyl cutting machine.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Principles of Engineering</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Principles of Engineering is a high school-level survey course of engineering. The course exposes students to some of the major concepts that they will encounter in a postsecondary engineering course of study. Students have an opportunity to investigate engineering and high tech careers. POE gives students the opportunity to develop skills and understanding of course concepts through activity-, project-, and problem-based (APPB) learning. Activities include robotics, structures, electronics, energy sources, and motion.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Engineering Design and Development – Sammamish Start-Ups</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Students work in teams to design and develop original solutions to valid, open-ended problems that will ultimately meet customer need and/or address unmet needs in the commercial, social, and global economy. By applying the design process and cultivating confidence as leaders, they will design, build, and test solutions while collaborating with industry professionals who provide mentoring opportunities. As a course summative, student teams will have the opportunity to present and defend their original solutions to a panel of experts, similar to a Shark Tank. This class lays the foundation for students interested in starting a business and potentially competing in the Lake Washington School District Teen CEO competition.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Materials Science Technology</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Materials Science Technology (MST) is a multidisciplinary approach to science and technology which teaches students to better understand the properties and uses of materials. It combines scientific theories, practical applications of technology, and hands-on experiences to prepare students to work in a technologically rich environment. The course is separated into the categories of Solids, Metals, Ceramics, Polymers, and Composites. A key feature of MST is the ability to use materials to solve problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Biotechnology</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If you like thinking about Biology, get ready to explore the exciting world of biotechnology in this one-year elective. You’ll experience technologies that allow you to understand cells, DNA, and proteins at the molecular level. In addition, we’ll consider how these technologies are used to develop vaccines and pharmaceutical drugs, explore career opportunities, and discuss bioethical issues based on biotechnology research.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Digital Production Studio</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Digital Production Studio provides you the opportunity to master your skills, techniques, and technologies in either photography or video production. You will work individually and collaboratively to develop a robust portfolio of work.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Digital Video</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Digital Video is an introductory class for those interested in video production. You will learn the process, tools, & techniques of digital storytelling through hands-on training and experience. Students work independently and in teams to write, shoot, and edit their own creations.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
