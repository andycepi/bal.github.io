	<h1>Our Mission</h1>
	<p>Here at Eastvape, we strive to achieve a world where robots and people can exist cohesively. We adhere strictly to the rules of robotics posed by Isaac Asimov:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to
    come to harm.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would
      conflict with the First Law.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict
      with the First or Second Law.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
