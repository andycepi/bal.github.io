	<h1>Technology</h1>
	<p>Although AI is still a relatively new field, there are several pre-established technologies that we gain inspiration from and continue to explore in HealthBot. Some of them include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>IBM's Watson</b>
      <p>By storing all available medical knowledge, Watson is able to make accurate diagnoses and decisions based solely on evidence. This reduces any doubt or mistakes that human doctors might make and is an extremely powerful tool. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Speech Recognition</b>
      <p>Turns speech (patients requests and input) into format useful for computer applications. Currently used in interactive voice response systems and mobile applications like OpenText and Verint.  </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Machine Learning</b>
      <p>Machine learning is the use of algorithms to "train" a computer to examine specific models and use the results of the training to make predictions based on what the machine has "learned". Itâ€™s a subset of AI and used in tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Biometrics</b>
      <p>Enables more natural interactions between humans and machines. Technologies that fall under this category include image, touch, and speech recognition. Currently used in the research market as seen in companies like FaceFirst and Agnitio.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
