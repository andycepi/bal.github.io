	<h1>Safety and Concerns</h1>
	<p>When dealing about AI Robots, safety is our primary concern. We adhere stricly to the Rules of Robotics posed by Isaac Asimov, which are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
    <li>A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
    <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Some concerns that our customers may have are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lack of human interaction leading to patients feeling depressed, worsening their health</li>
    <li>Malfunction or loss of power during a critical time (ex. patient has a stroke)</li>
    <li>Lack of adaptability the human doctors/nurses have (ex. response to natural catastrophes, fires, lockdown procedures)</li>
    <li>Takes up jobs, therefore increasing the unemployment rate</li>
    <li>AI Robots are very costly </li>
    <li>Some patients might have issues being treated by a robot and refuse to cooperate, disparity between quality of human and robot doctors</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, we wish to address these concerns and dispel any notion of fear. We ensure that BAL Healthbots undergo rigorous testing procedures and have countless safeguards in place to provide the safest human-robot interation possible.</p>
  <p>To address some of these concerns, we are doing the following: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating robots with a friendly design that doesn't try too hard to look human, but has a human-like personality</li>
    <li>Creating a robust AI system that can recognize and adapt to any situation</li>
    <li>Regular software updates to constantly improve our Healthbots to match the needs of the growing medical world and fix any bugs that may be present</li>
    <li>Robots and nurses/doctors can coexist to make the hospital more efficient, and we understand that face-to-face interations with patients are a vital part of the healthcare industry and cannot be replaced, so we will never try to get rid of them</li>
    <li>Costs will continue to decrease as we increase out research and develop cheaper and more sophisticated technology</li>

  </ul>
