	<h1>Safety and Concerns</h1>
	<p>When dealing about AI Robots, safety is our primary concern. We adhere stricly to the Rules of Robotics posed by Isaac Asimov, which are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>
    <li>A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
    <li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Some concerns that our customers may have are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lack of human interaction leading to patients feeling depressed, worsening their health</li>
    <li>Malfunction or loss of power during a critical time (ex. patient has a stroke)</li>
    <li>Lack of adaptability the human doctors/nurses have (ex. response to natural catastrophes, fires, lockdown procedures)</li>
    <li>Takes up jobs, therefore increasing the unemployment rate</li>
    <li>Ai Robots are very costly </li>
    <li>Some patients might have issues being treated by a robot and refuse to cooperate, disparity between quality of human and robot doctors</li>
  </ul>
